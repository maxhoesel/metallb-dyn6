# This workflow automatically creates a PR that, when merged, will automatically
# trigger the next release.
#
# The release PR bumps the version number in affected files, such as Cargo.toml, helm charts, pyproject.toml, etc.
#
# The actual release is published by the release-push.yml workflow, while artifacts are built by publish.yml
